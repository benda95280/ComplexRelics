    (prevent cheat)
- Item can or cannot be stacked
- Can be obtained with the right tool or not
- Can be disabled for OP

	$itemArray[1] = array(283, 284, 285, 286, 294, 314, 315, 316, 317, 261);
	$itemArray[2] = array(272, 273, 274, 275, 291, 302, 303, 304, 305);

I'm not author of this plugin.
I'm only working on it for a project for my childs.
Any Help / PR / Issue are always welcome, but i'm a junior Dev, i'll do my best !
I've decided to share my work for the hard work of some (few) people, who are working hard, to make it better

## Thanks to:
Thanks for the people on the Discord chanel who helped me, and of course, DuoIncure for this awsome plugin.
